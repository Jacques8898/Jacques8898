## Hello beautiful people!

I'm Jacques, 26 years old from Surrey, and I'm looking to get into the tech sector. Currently I'm learning **Python**, all thanks to **CoGrammar**'s cybersecurity fundamentals boot camp course. As this is my first venture into tech, I'm only a beginner, *but* I'm very much enjoying the learning process so far. 
A few facts about me:

- I have a BSc in Mathematics from University of Surrey
- I worked in the retail/catering for almost 8 years, greatly building my interpersonal skills
- I have a variety of hobbies, from discovering new music to working on self improvement in many games I play
